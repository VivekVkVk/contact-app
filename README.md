The Contact Directory App is a user-friendly tool designed for efficiently managing and navigating a contact list. It features a responsive interface that works seamlessly across desktop and mobile devices. The frontend is developed using ReactJS, providing an interactive and smooth user experience. Users can view contacts, search for specific names, and navigate the contact list through an intuitive sidebar. The sidebar allows users to jump to specific contact sections based on the first letter of the name, particularly useful for large directories. A pop-up displays detailed contact information when a user clicks on a contact, providing easy access to essential data like phone numbers and emails. The app also allows users to add new contacts and download the entire contact list as a CSV file. The backend is built using Flask and SQLLite for efficient data storage. The application is containerized using Docker for scalability and consistent deployment across different environments. Overall, the Contact Directory App combines modern web technologies for a seamless experience for managing and navigating contacts.
